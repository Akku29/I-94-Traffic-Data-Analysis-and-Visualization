# I-94 Traffic Data Analysis and Visualization
 This project aims to analyze the reasons of heavier traffic in the I-94 highway. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. This dataset was created by John Hogue and can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).

The dataset documentation mentions that a station located approximately midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul recorded the traffic data. Also, the station only records westbound traffic (cars moving from east to west). This means that the results of our analysis will be about the westbound traffic in the proximity of that station. In other words, we should avoid generalizing our results for the entire I-94 highway.
